# QUESTION: What is this document about?
# This document is about the Transformer model, a type of neural network architecture that has been proposed as a solution to the challenge of 
# sequence transduction tasks. The Transformer model is designed to be simple, efficient, and parallelizable, and it has shown superior 
# performance compared to other models on various tasks.
